1. Conceptualize a social enterprise to serve one or several of your communities
An idea that I would have is selling snacks at the community pool. After you hop out of the pool, sometimes you feel hungry or thirsty. So I think having those snacks accessible to people pool side would be beneficial. 


2. Strategize what is the best possible legal structure for you business to take; choose a structure
I think a parternship would be good because you have two sources of income to buy the snacks. You also have different pitches and different ways to get people to buy these snacks. There could also be connections and ties to people at the pool because it's in your community.
