        <li>Drake</li>

        <a href="https://youtu.be/8ekJMC8OtGU?si=gVNXapj2TpUpA8Ko">Nokia by Drake</a>
        <p>I like this artist because his lyrics have lots of meaning and he consistently drops bangers. Even though he lost against Kendrick in the rap beef,
            he was able to come back and drop a good album. What I like most about Drake is his consistency. He's always dropping heat each year and I still
        can't understand why people find ways to hate on each album. </p>

        <li>Gunna</li>

        <a href="https://youtu.be/HqiZRQHhqQs?si=ZVHdp73Khw3xHwG">one of wun by Gunna</a>
        <p>I like this artist because he has a different type of flow from the rest of rap. He always has good lyrics and play with his words. He always has
            good collaborations and the combination with his beats and flow makes his music very catchy and nice to listen to.

    <div>
        <li>Lil Baby</li>
        <img src="lilbaby.jpeg">
        <a href="https://youtu.be/MHryuYVyHhk?si=gpYx9M7eeQMclwK8">Freestyle by Lil Baby</a>
        <p>I like this artist because what he says in his lyrics, he actually went through. The trouble and struggles he has been through makes the music somewhat
            deep. I like his consistency and his ability to not switch up his flow. Some songs I really like are popular songs Yes Indeed and Freestyle by him.
