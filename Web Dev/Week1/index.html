                Hi, My name is Braylen Cunningham. I'm 16 years old and I live in Fairfield, CA.
                I am a junior in high school and I go to Rodriguez High School. In my free time I like to play basketball,
                run track, play video games, relax, and travel the world. 
            
            </p>
                I haven't been at THGP long but I've learned a little bit about computational learning
                and leadership skills.
